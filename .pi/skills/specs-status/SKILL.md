  Show the current state of the spec tree and change pipeline: active changes, completed versions,
  and component health. Report step in the change pipeline (explore → propose → issue → sync → execute)
  — the spec-side status; issue-side status lives on the GitHub project board (see github-project-manager /
  github-issue-tracker, global skills). Use when the user wants to know what's in flight or what shipped.

# specs-status

> Report the current state of the spec tree and change pipeline.

## Change Pipeline

```
idea → specs-explore → specs-propose → specs-issue → specs-sync → github-issue-tracker
```

Status observes the spec side of the pipeline (active changes, synced versions). For the execution side (issues on the board), use the GitHub project board via `github-project-manager` / `github-issue-tracker`.

## Steps

### 1. Read the change tracker

Read `docs/changes/README.md` — the Active Changes and Completed Versions tables.

### 2. Walk the change tree

For each `docs/changes/<version>/` directory:

- List active change folders with their S-codes, status, and spec-refs.
- `grep` the frontmatter of each `proposal.md` for status, s-code, spec-refs.

### 3. Walk the spec tree

For each component in `docs/specs/`, count features and their statuses.

### 4. Present the report

```text
