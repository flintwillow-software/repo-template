  Step 2 of the d3 workflow: take a case study and turn it into approved spec tree updates.
  Runs a gap analysis against the spec trees of the relevant repos, writes spec-updates.md
  documenting proposed new or changed specs, presents it for human review and approval, then
  applies approved updates directly to docs/specs/ in the target repo(s). Use after d3-proposals
  has created or updated the case study, or when the user wants to take a case study into spec.

## The 5-Step d3 Workflow

```
Step 1: idea/chat → case study                                 (d3-proposals)
Step 2: case study → spec tree updates (docs/specs/)           (this skill)
Step 3: spec diff → change log (docs/changes/<version>/)       (d3-changes)
Step 4: change log → epics/issues/sub-issues in PM tool        (d3-issues)
```

Step 2 ends with the spec tree updated directly. Step 3 then derives what code must change.

## Steps

### 1. Read the case study

- Read the case study files: `README.md`, `CONTEXT.md`, `SOLUTION.md`, `RESULTS.md`.
- Understand the demands: what features, components, or capabilities does the case study describe?
- Identify which repos would need spec changes (`repos/*/`, `infra/*/`).

### 2. Gap analysis against current specs

Walk the spec trees of the relevant repos (`repos/*/docs/specs/README.md` or
`infra/*/docs/specs/README.md`) and map:

| Case study demand | Supporting spec | Gap |
|-------------------|-----------------|-----|
| (from the case study) | existing component/feature that covers it | missing, partial, or planned |

- Use `d3-render` for the holistic spec picture of each repo.
- A demand is a gap when no spec covers it, the spec is `planned`, or the spec exists in a
  different repo than the one that should own it.
- Note which repo each gap belongs to — the update lands there.

### 3. Write spec-updates.md

Create **`spec-updates.md`** in the case study folder — the proposal document:

```markdown
# Spec Updates

> Proposed new or changed specs required to execute this case study. Reviewed and approved by a human
> before any spec tree is edited.

| Spec Code | Repo | File | Type | Why |
|-----------|------|------|------|-----|
| S130000 | repos/opennavi | docs/specs/13-tool-catalog/00-tool-catalog-overview.md | added | standard tool set for the coding agent |

## Per-Update Details

### S130000 (added)
- **Repo/file:** repos/opennavi/docs/specs/13-tool-catalog/00-tool-catalog-overview.md
- **What:** component + 4 features covering the 13 standard tools
- **Why:** the case study's tool system has no spec
```

- Each row maps to a gap from step 2. Spec codes follow the target repo's numbering conventions.
- If the result is "no gaps" (every demand already spec'd), say so clearly and stop.

### 4. Human review and approval

- Present `spec-updates.md` to the user for review.
- Do **NOT** edit any `docs/specs/` file until the human approves the updates.
- Iterate on the proposal based on feedback.
- Approval can be per-update or whole-file — apply only what's approved.

### 5. Apply the approved updates directly to the spec tree(s)

For each approved update, edit the target repo's `docs/specs/` **in place**:

- New component: create `NN-component/` with README + feature files, register in the tree root.
- New feature: create `NN-feature.md`, add to the component README table, update the tree root.
- Modified feature: edit the file — new subfeatures at the end (append), update `spec-refs`
  (append only), add a Status History row.
- Update the tree root `docs/specs/README.md` (component table, status, latest version).
- Register the change in `docs/changes/README.md` (Active Changes table).
- Commit per repo.

> No change dirs, no proposal/design/tasks scaffolding, no GitHub issues at this stage. The spec tree
> is the source of truth; d3-changes derives the work from the diff.

- Creating or updating case studies → `d3-proposals`
- Generating change docs from the spec diff → `d3-changes`
- Creating GitHub issues → `d3-issues`
